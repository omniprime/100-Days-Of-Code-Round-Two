# 100 Days Of Code Round Two - Log

### Day 1: January 2nd, 2018
Today's Progress: FCC Calculator

Thoughts: Tried to jump back in where I left off last April or May with the FCC calculator. I have already forgotten a lot of what I learned last year. It makes sense since I did not use any code from when I stopped to today. Made very little progress, but did find some good research spots. Will take another attempt tomorrow.

### Day 2: January 3rd, 2018

Today's Progress: FCC Calculator Design

Thoughts: Formatted the calc to the basic layout of how I want it. Not pretty yet, but that can be changed easily later. Took longer than I thought because I had to look up flexboxing more today. Going to try and do a refresher on my JS so I can make it function. Going to try to look over old code tomorrow at work to remind me how it all works together.

### Day 3: January 9th, 2018

Today's Progress: AngularJS

Thoughts: I have done a little between day two and three, but I am not going to count it towards my 100. I fell into a funk of depression and self pitty that did not motivate me to code at all. I inspired myself some more last night and will be spending more of my time learning than playing. 
I was going to start coding my JS for the calculator, but realized that since it has been a few months since I have used it, I was not sure where best to start with it. I decided to take a quick refresher on codecademy for JS and realized that that basic class would not help me. Instead I started the AngularJS course. Some of the tasks on there need to be adjusted, but I think I have a decent grasp on what was going on. I'm going to try and continue more tonight and make edits to this file when I am done.

### Day 4: January 11th, 2018

Today's Progress: The Odin Project and Git

Thoughts: I heard about the Odin Project and thought I would give it a go. I probably should have looked a little closer to it before starting. It seems like it is very Mac and Linix focused and anti Windows (which I run on). I can't say that I blame them for that because I am not always thrilled with Windows, but I am not able to make the switch right now and only have the one system to run on. Because of this, I think I am going to pass on going further with the Odin Project and go back to FCC and Codecademy. I did learn a bit more about Git and Github with it and think that I will start posting more of my web stuff on Github to help with version control.
