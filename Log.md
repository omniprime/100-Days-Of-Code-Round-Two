# 100 Days Of Code Round Two - Log

### Day 1: January 2nd, 2018
Today's Progress: FCC Calculator

Thoughts: Tried to jump back in where I left off last April or May with the FCC calculator. I have already forgotten a lot of what I learned last year. It makes sense since I did not use any code from when I stopped to today. Made very little progress, but did find some good research spots. Will take another attempt tomorrow.

### Day 2: January 3rd, 2018

Today's Progress: FCC Calculator Design

Thoughts: Formatted the calc to the basic layout of how I want it. Not pretty yet, but that can be changed easily later. Took longer than I thought because I had to look up flexboxing more today. Going to try and do a refresher on my JS so I can make it function. Going to try to look over old code tomorrow at work to remind me how it all works together.
